The objective of this analytics is to venture out a feasiblity of establishing a small business enterprise in a particular neighborhood in the city of Ottawa. For this purpose, I am selecting a neighborhood called *Orleans-Ottawa* which is one of the fast populating neighborhoods in the capilal city. I am interested in setting up a *Bookstore* in the *Orleans* neighborhood of the city. Hence my objective would be to see whehter it is feasible to set up a *Bookstore* in the *Orleans* neighborhood or not. If there is no such enterprise already existing that neighborhood apart from other basic businesses, then I will definitely go for it.\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3.5", "name": "python3", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"mimetype": "text/x-python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "version": "3.5.5", "name": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "file_extension": ".py", "codemirror_mode": {"version": 3, "name": "ipython"}}}, "nbformat": 4}
