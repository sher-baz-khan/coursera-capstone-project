This data is in raw form. I observed that this data does not include GPS coordinates corresponding to the postal codes of all the neighborhoods of the city. For this purpose I am going to extact the data for respective coordinates from another web sourse called *https://www.gps-coordinates.net/*. \n\nBefore manipulating the data obtained from the sources mentioned above it is necessary to clean the data. First and foremost, I will remove that part of data which is not related to my investigation like removing those neighborhoods which do not fall into the city of Ottawa and also those postal codes which have *not yet been assigned* or *not in use*. After cleansing the data, I will incorporate the data containing *Latitudes* and *Longitudes* of respective postal codes of the neighborhoods. Having cleaned the location data of neighborhoods I will create a data frame using the *Pandas* library in *Python*.\n\nI will use the *Foursquare API* to explore neighborhoods in Ottawa ON. I will use the *explore* function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. I will also use the *k*-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. Finally, I will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in Ottawa ON and their emerging clusters. I will focus on the particular neighborhood *Orleans-Ottawa* to see the possibility of establishing a *Bookstore* in that neighborhood.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3.5", "name": "python3", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"mimetype": "text/x-python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "version": "3.5.5", "name": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "file_extension": ".py", "codemirror_mode": {"version": 3, "name": "ipython"}}}, "nbformat": 4}
